# svelte-pieces

## 1.0.12

### Patch Changes

- - Add changesets
  - [Breaking] Note: if you previously used `<Button form="primary"...` that attribute was changed to `<Button form="filled"` several versions back before changesets were in use (yes, semver isn't supposed to have breaking changes, but switch to 1.0.0 too soon).
