# Kitbook Template

A simple template that you can use to get started with Kitbook. This template is a demo of Kitbook placed as a sub-route in an already existing app since the Kitbook examples are separate packages found in monorepos. See the [Kitbook docs](https://kitbook.vercel.app/) for examples and information on how to build a Kitbook.
