# rehype-display-link-titles

A simple [rehype plugin](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype/blob/main/doc/plugins.md) for use in Kitbook to take titles from auto-generated `<a>` tags (produced via [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/) and [MDSvex](https://mdsvex.pngwn.io/)) and make them the main text. This allows for using a wikilink like `[[8-examples]]` which would normally pull the title (e.g. `Examples`) from the linked documented (links auto-generated by Foam). However, sometimes in prose you want to use an alias for said page being linked to, `[[8-examples|Kitbook Supported Examples]]`. If a title is detected, this plugin takes the resulting link text of `Examples` and swaps it with the title text of `Kitbook Supported Examples`.
