export { layoutLoad as load } from '../';

// You can replace the default layout load function with your own if you want to customize file endings and/or directories to scan. Start by copying from Kitbook's imported load file above. See https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#glob-import for help writing glob imports if needed.
