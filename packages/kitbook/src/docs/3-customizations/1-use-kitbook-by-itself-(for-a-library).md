# How to Use Kitbook by Itself

If you look in [Kitbook's source code](https://github.com/jacob-8/kitbook/tree/main/packages/kitbook) you'll see the `routes` folder living inside of the `lib` directory (so it will be packaged up) or in [Svelte Pieces' source code](https://github.com/jacob-8/kitbook/tree/main/packages/svelte-pieces) you'll see a `src/routes` folder and no `src/kitbook` folder.

When you are only building a library and not an app, then there is no main app to run Kitbook alongside and your Kitbook becomes your main app. You could just delete the `src/routes` folder and leave Kitbook alone in it's default `src/kitbook` folder. However, if for clarity or some other reason you want to adjust where Kitbook lives (e.g. `src/routes`) you can pass the path to the Kitbook plugin:

```diff
// vite.config.js
import { sveltekit } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite';
import { kitbook } from 'kitbook/plugins/vite';

const config = {
	plugins: [
+		kitbook({routes: 'src/routes'}),
		sveltekit(),
	],
};

export default config;
```

Then add some custom Kitbook-only Svelte config options in your svelte config:

```js
// svelte.config.js
/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const kitbookOptions = { 
  kit: { 
    files: { 
      routes: 'src/routes',
    },
    outDir: '.svelte-kit',
  }
}
export default augmentSvelteConfigForKitbook(config, { kitbookOptions });
```

You may be asking why not just leave `svelte.config.js` alone and remove `augmentSvelteConfigForKitbook` altogether? That function is still needed to add other important items such as the default `app.html` (See [[2-app-html]]) for your Kitbook, as well as to pass the default file extensions (and other `svelte.config.js` related Kitbook options added in the future).

Lastly, if you are happy with the default Kitbook styling, you can go ahead and delete the standard SvelteKit `app.html` sitting in your repo because Kitbook provides its own.
