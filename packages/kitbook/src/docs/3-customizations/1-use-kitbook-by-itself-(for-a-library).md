# How to Use Kitbook by Itself

If you look in [Kitbook's source code](https://github.com/jacob-8/kitbook/tree/main/packages/kitbook) you'll see the `routes` folder living inside of the `lib` directory (so it will be packaged up) or in [Svelte Pieces' source code](https://github.com/jacob-8/kitbook/tree/main/packages/svelte-pieces) you'll see a `src/routes` folder and no `src/kitbook` folder.

When you are only building a library and not an app, then there is no main app to run Kitbook alongside and your Kitbook becomes your main app. You could just delete the `src/routes` folder and leave Kitbook alone in it's default `src/kitbook` folder. However, if for clarity you'd like to tell Kitbook to have its route come from `src/routes` you can pass the path to the Kitbook plugin:

```diff
// vite.config.js
import { sveltekit } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite';
import { kitbook } from 'kitbook/plugins/vite';

const config = {
	plugins: [
+		kitbook({routes: 'src/routes'}),
		sveltekit(),
	],
};

export default config;
```

Also, if you are happy with the default Kitbook styling, you can go ahead and delete the standard SvelteKit `app.html` sitting in your repo because Kitbook provides its own. If you prefer to provide your own `app.html` see [[2-app-html]].
