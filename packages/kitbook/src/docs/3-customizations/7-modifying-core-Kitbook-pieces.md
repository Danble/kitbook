# Modifying Core Kitbook Pieces

Kitbook is not yet stable and you probably shouldn't even be using it yet unless you're willing to be a contributor and fix the problems you run into. But at some point it will be stable and you may want to customize the module loading behavior.

If this is for you, then you can piece together your own routes directory using Kitbook's as a starting point. Make sure to point update Kitbook's routes folder via modifying the [[6-customize-sveltekit-config]] option.
