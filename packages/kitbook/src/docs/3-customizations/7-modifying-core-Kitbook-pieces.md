# Modifying Core Kitbook Pieces

Kitbook is not yet stable and you probably shouldn't even be using it yet unless you're willing to be a contributor and fix the problems you run into. But at some point it will be stable and you may want to customize the module loading behavior.

If this is for you, after you run Kitbook at least once to create a `src/kitbook` folder, as described in [[1-use-kitbook-by-itself-(for-a-library)#Understand Kitbook's Initialization]]. From here you can dig into any of the default page or load functions and create your own to replace them with your desired behavior.

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[1-use-kitbook-by-itself-(for-a-library)#Understand Kitbook's Initialization]: 1-use-kitbook-by-itself-(for-a-library).md "Use Kitbook by Itself"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
