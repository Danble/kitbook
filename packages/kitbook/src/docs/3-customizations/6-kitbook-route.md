# Customize Routes location

The routes location will be inherited from what was passed to your Kitbook Vite plugin (as demonstrated in [[1-use-kitbook-by-itself-(for-a-library)]]), but you may still want to customize other related settings, such as whether you need to have a secondary output directory or not:

```js title="svelte.config.js"
/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const kitbookOptions = { 
  kit: { 
    outDir: '.svelte-kit',
  }
}
export default augmentSvelteConfigForKitbook(config, { kitbookOptions });
```
