# Add Basic Documentation

You can create a folder with any name under your `/src` folder and begin writing documentation in markdown. This Kitbook has a `docs` folder, which is where this file exists as can be seen in the sidebar navigation. Since `mdsvex` is activated on all `.md` and `.svx` files you can also include Svelte components as needed.

## Kitbook Index

By default Kitbook will display your project's README.md file as it's home/index page, but you can override this by using a `src/docs/index.{md|svx}` file.
