# Get Started: How to Create a KitBook

- Install the `kitbook` package: `npm i -D kitbook` or `pnpm add -D kitbook`

- Add the `kitbook()` plugin before your `sveltekit()` plugin in `vite.config.js`:
```diff
import { sveltekit } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite';
+import { kitbook } from 'kitbook/plugins/vite';

const config = {
	plugins: [
+		kitbook(),
		sveltekit(),
	],
};

export default config;
```

- Add the following scripts to your `package.json`:
```json
"kitbook": "vite dev --mode kitbook",
"kitbook:build": "vite build --mode kitbook",
"kitbook:preview": "vite preview --mode kitbook",
```

- Run `npm kitbook` or `pnpm kitbook` to get going! 
 
Since this will be your first time running the `kitbook` plugin in your package, it will automatically copy a Kitbook routes folder into your `src/kitbook` directory, as well as a function to adjust your `svelte.config.js` file to use this folder for routes when running Vite in `kitbook` mode. *See the Customizations folder to learn how to modify Kitbook's default routes location.*

You'll also notice that since you're now running a 2nd SvelteKit app inside the same directory (not a normal use-case), SvelteKit's automatically generated files for your Kitbook app will be placed into `/.svelte-kit-kitbook` in order to not conflict with your main app's generated files in `/.svelte-kit`. What you should know is that can ignore the warning that shows up upon running kitbook: `Your tsconfig.json should extend the configuration generated by SvelteKit...`. You will also want to **add an asterisk** to `/.svelte-kit` in your `.gitignore` file to modify it to `/.svelte-kit*` so that folder isn't committed.

At this point you can open Kitbook and see all your Svelte components, *including `+page.svelte` and `+layout.svelte` files as they are also just plain Svelte components with a very important `data` prop*. In the future Kitbook will automatically provide default props according to automatically generated type definitions, but for the moment, things are kind of boring. Why don't you...
