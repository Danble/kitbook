# Runner-UI
Components I use across projects

## To update NPM package
Run `npm version patch` which will bump from 1.0.2 to 1.0.3 for example and then commit the changes, and push changes to GitHub which will automatically fire off an NPM publish

## Svench, not working at the moment (like Storybook)
`npx svench`

### TODO
